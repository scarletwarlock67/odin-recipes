  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar</li>

  <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

 <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Stir in spaghettini and return,<br/>
        to a boil. Cook pasta until it has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 6 to<br/>
        8 minutes. Drain well and keep warm.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in tomatoes; cook<br/>
        until they soften and begin to break down. Stir in garlic powder, oregano, basil,<br/>
        salt, pepper, sugar, and ketchup. Heat sauce through and reserve.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a separate cast iron skillet over medium<br/>
        heat. Stir in chicken; cook until browned. Stir in garlic cloves; cook for 1<br/>
        additional minute.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove chicken from skillet and reserve. Turn heat to high. Stir bell peppers,<br/>
        onion, and mushrooms into the skillet and cook until they begin to soften. Stir in<br/>
        browned chicken. Turn heat to medium and cook until chicken is no longer pink<br/>
        in the center and vegetables are cooked through, about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Toss chicken and vegetables with tomato sauce and hot pasta. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.
    </li>
