  <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>
     American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I was growing up.
     They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of buttered white bread and a carton of milk.
     This Americanized version of goulash was invented to stretch a small amount of beef
     into enough food for a not-so-small family. It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple,
     so it's perfect for your weeknight dinner rotation.

        stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5<br/>
        minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add<br/>
        garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.

        broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl,<br/>
        and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to<br/>
        medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes.

        Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in macaroni;<br/>

        Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and parsley. Cover<br/>
